**Models and Datasets**

We will employ a custom-designed CNN architecture to classify the MRI images accurately. The architecture will consist of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, ending with a softmax layer to output probabilities for each class.

The dataset for this project will be sourced from a publicly available repository on Kaggle, such as the "Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)" dataset. This dataset contains annotated MRI scans categorized into different tumor types and healthy controls.

** Data Visualization:**
 
I displayed a few samples from the Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset along with the number of samples for each type of tumor in each picture folder to help better understanding the dataset. The MRI pictures utilized in the project and the general appearance of the dataset are shown in the following examples:

Glioma Tumor:

Gliomas, accounting for 30% of all brain and central nervous system tumors, originate from the glial cells in the brain or spine. Most of them are cancerous, with symptoms that differ depending on where they're located, often causing seizures, cognitive impairments, or motor deficits.

Meningioma Tumor:

Meningiomas are tumors that develop slowly from the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Although they usually show no symptoms, they can result in seizures, cognitive decline, vision disturbances, or motor deficits based on where they are located.

Pituitary Tumor:

Mostly non-cancerous pituitary adenomas make up 10-25% of tumors in the pituitary gland. They might lead to hormonal disruptions, leading to a range of issues such as migraines, changes in vision, or hormonal problems.
